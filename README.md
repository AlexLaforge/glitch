A simple program to apply common glitch effects to an image.
Requires ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org)

I'm running on an Arch Linux machine, I just had to install ImageMagick through pacman. 
Your milage may varry based upon your OS and such.
I have gotten this to fully build and run on my own Raspberry PI, which is running Arch as well.

My version of ImageMagick is ImageMagick 6.9.2.0-1.

Plans and ideas:
  - More effects!
      - General curruption of the image.
      - Artifacting.
  - GUI
  - 

Known bugs:
  - I once got a weird seg-fault when I had made an image with a black background in GIMP and ran it through this. Only happened with that one image and I have yet to reproduce the issue in any other way.
